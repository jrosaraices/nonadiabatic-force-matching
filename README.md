# Data supplement: _Nonadiabatic force matching for alchemical free-energy estimation_

This repository contains all of the numerical results presented in the journal article titled ___Nonadiabatic force matching for alchemical free-energy estimation___, authored by [Jorge L. Rosa-Ra√≠ces](mailto:jrosaraices@berkeley.edu) and [David T. Limmer](mailto:dlimmer@berkeley.edu) at UC Berkeley.  The article is currently available [on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01582).  This repository is organized as follows:

- Folder `numerical_results` encloses the simulation data plotted in the article, along with the _Python 3_ scripts used to generate corresponding figures.
- Folder `simulation_scripts` encloses all of the _Python 3_ scripts that were used to generate the raw simulation data for the WCA monomer solvation and the LJ solid formation in the article.  The scripts crucially depend on CUDA-enabled installations of the [HOOMD-blue](https://hoomd-blue.readthedocs.io/en/v5.1.0/) and [PyTorch](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/2.6/) packages.  Alongside the _Python 3_ scripts, each folder contains _bash_ scripts with command-line instructions to generate the trajectory data for each system with the appropriate simulation parameters.
- Folder `post-processing_scripts` encloses _Python 3_ scripts to postprocess the raw trajectory data generated by the code in `simulation_scripts`, and _bash_ scripts with command-line instructions to run the corresponding _Python 3_ scripts.
- Folder `plotting_scripts` encloses _Python 3_ scripts to generate the figures in the article from the post-processed trajectory data generated by the scripts in `post-processing_scripts` for each system.

While the code provided herein should be sufficient to fully reproduce the numerical results presented in the article, the authors will gladly provide the raw and post-processed numerical data upon reasonable request.
